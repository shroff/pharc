        A general function for advanced searches. Returns a list of
        objects that fit the given parameters.

        Args:

            queries: a list of "Query" namedtuples containing
                parameters for the search. Each element of the list is
                a tuple of the form (field, match, arg). The result
                will satisfy _all_ parameters and will contain the
                indicated ranking information. The field and match
                fields of a search param are strings and the last is
                determined by teh first two. The same parameter can be
                specified multiple times and it will apply multiple
                times; all results will still satisfy all passed
                params. There are two types of queries: constraint
                queries and ranking queries. Constraint queries
                constrain results. Ranking queries rank results in the
                returned list of patients. If a ranking query is
                submitted multiple times, results are undefined, but
                the returned scores will attempt to reflect a 'do what

            n: how many results to return at most. If this is set to
                None, it is entirely possible that every patient in
                the database will be returned.

        Returns:
            A list of (patient, scores) tuples. Returns an empty list
            of no patients were found that fit the constraints. Every
            patient in the list will satisfy _all_ of the parameters
            of the query. scores is a dictionary that maps strings to
            particular scores assigned by the search function. These
            are the scores that will be returned:
            
            key         value semantics
            "fname_lcs" the length of the lcs between the query and the patient's first_name
            "lname_lcs" the length of the lcs between the query and the patient's last_name
            "diags"     number of diagnosis tags in both the query and the patient's list
            "treats"    number of treatment tags in both the query and the patient's list
            "phys_one"  length of the single best lcs match in the patient's list of physicians
            "phys_all"  sum of the lcs lengths in the max-weight matching of query params to physicians
            "notes_one" number of times words in a query string occur in the notes
            "notes_ex"  number of times exact string queries occur in the notes
            "overall"   take all the others, normalize them, add them together, and renormalize.
            
            scores for which a query does not exist to measure against
            will not be reported. For example, if no diagnosis tags
            are specified, "diags" cannot be calculated and will not
            be returned.

            If multiple queries are submitted that would produce the
            same score, results are undefined, but the implementation
            will attempt to return a reasonable "do-what-I-mean"
            interpretation.
