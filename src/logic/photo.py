    A singel Photo object stores the information required to work with
    a photo and provides functions that hide FS and GUI functionality
    from each other. It stores the filename of a photo (for example,
    "DSC0000001.jpg") as well as a pointer to the photoset that this
    photo is a part of so that the entire path can be
    constructed.

            to get the full path.
