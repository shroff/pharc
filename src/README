PHARC is a photo archiving system designed to organize physicians' photos. It
allows users to import photos and add them to different patients.

Each patient has multiple photosets, which have associated treatments and
diagnoses for each date.


============
INSTALLATION
============

This application needs the following packages:

- Python 3.2
- PyQT4
- odfpy3
- dnspython3

odfpy3 and dnspython3 can be installed using PIP (python package index)

Additionally, if you need to create a test datase, you will also need to install
the python imaging library. Keep in mind that as of right now (April 2012) PIL
does not work with python3.
